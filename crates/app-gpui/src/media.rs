//! Image plumbing between core's guarded fetch and gpui's `img` element.
//!
//! TODO(port): crates/app/src/media_cache.rs + cards.rs media_picture — P2/P3.
//! core's `fetch_image` (SSRF-guarded, sha256-keyed disk cache) hands back
//! the original bytes (plus a ≤128px disc thumb) which we hand to gpui's
//! image pipeline. A global cache shares results across views (cards,
//! lightbox, avatars all key on the same URL):
//!   - Ready — painted.
//!   - NotMedia — the bytes arrived whole and are not an image (a blossom
//!     page URL); degrades to a link, never refetched.
//!   - Failed — a transient failure (weather, rate limit): cools off with a
//!     doubling backoff and tries again. Nothing media-shaped is ever
//!     written off because a CDN hiccuped.
//!
//! Verdicts ("the bytes decoded to nothing") are remembered so a page URL
//! degrades to a link instead of refetching every render.
